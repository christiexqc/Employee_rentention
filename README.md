Data:employee_retention.csv
Notebook:employee_retention.ipynb

We got employee data from a few companies. We have data about all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. For each employee, we also know if they are still at the company as of 2015/12/13 or they have quit. Beside that, we have general info about the employee, such as avg salary during her tenure, dept, and yrs of experience.

The tasks which were accomplished:

built the model to  predict employee retention and understand its main drivers. 

Investigated the main factors that drive employee churn?

Identified the most inportant variable which can explain the employee churn
